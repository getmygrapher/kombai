Conduct a thorough analysis of documents Job_Posting_System_Flow.md and JOB_POSTING_SYSTEM_TASKS.md , comparing them against the current codebase implementation. Specifically evaluate the job-related features to identify any discrepancies between documented requirements and actual functionality. Document all gaps found, including missing features, incomplete implementations, or deviations from specifications. Provide a detailed report categorizing each gap by severity and impact on system functionality.




Job Posting System Gap Analysis Report
1. Routing & Navigation Implementation
High Severity Gaps
Missing React Router Integration: The current implementation uses modal-based navigation with state management instead of the required React Router v7 declarative routing specified in the tasks document.
No Deep-Linkable Routes: The system lacks the specified routes like /jobs, /jobs/new/basic, etc., preventing direct URL access to specific sections.
Medium Severity Gaps
Bottom Navigation Integration: The current implementation uses state-based tab switching (setCurrentTab('jobs')) rather than proper route navigation.
2. Data Models & Store Implementation
High Severity Gaps
Incomplete Job Interface: The current implementation lacks several fields specified in the flow document, such as timeSlots, expiresAt, and viewCount.
Missing Dedicated Store Slices: Instead of dedicated jobsPostingStore.ts and jobsDiscoveryStore.ts as specified, job state is managed within the general appStore.ts.
Medium Severity Gaps
Draft Persistence: No implementation of the required draft persistence with localStorage via Zustand persist.
No Version/Migration Support: Missing version and migration placeholders for data persistence.
3. Job Creation Wizard
High Severity Gaps
Form Validation Framework: Uses ad-hoc validation instead of the required react-hook-form + zod schema approach.
Missing Autosave Functionality: No implementation of autosave with timestamp display.
Medium Severity Gaps
Location Input: Current implementation lacks GPS integration and map preview.
PIN Code Validation: No specific validation for Indian PIN codes.
Rich Text Editor: Missing rich text capabilities for job description.
4. Job Discovery & Search
High Severity Gaps
Infinite Scroll: No implementation of infinite scroll for job listings.
URL-Driven Filters: Filters are not reflected in URL parameters for shareable searches.
Medium Severity Gaps
Proximity Sorting: Missing proper implementation of location-based sorting.
Pull-to-Refresh: No implementation of pull-to-refresh functionality.
5. Job Management
High Severity Gaps
Application Management: Limited implementation of application tracking and status changes.
Job Actions: Missing implementation of Edit, Close, Extend, Delete, and Duplicate actions.
Medium Severity Gaps
Status Transitions: No proper implementation of job status transitions.
Empty States: Limited implementation of empty states for different job categories.
6. Shared Components & Utilities
High Severity Gaps
LocationInput Component: Missing reusable LocationInput component with GPS integration.
Job Validation Utilities: No dedicated validation utilities for job-related fields.
Medium Severity Gaps
Analytics Events: Missing implementation of job-related analytics events.
Accessibility Features: Limited implementation of accessibility features like focus trapping and keyboard navigation.
7. Performance & Technical Implementation
High Severity Gaps
Code Splitting: No implementation of route-level code splitting.
List Virtualization: Missing virtualization for job feed performance.
Medium Severity Gaps
Debounce Implementation: No debouncing for filter changes.
Component Memoization: Limited use of memoization for heavy components.
8. Security & Privacy
Medium Severity Gaps
Input Sanitization: Limited implementation of input sanitization.
Location Privacy: Missing "hide exact location" toggle.
Summary of Implementation Status
The current implementation provides a basic framework for job posting functionality but falls short of the comprehensive system outlined in the documentation. Key areas requiring attention include:

1.
Routing: Implement React Router v7 declarative routing
2.
Data Management: Create dedicated store slices with proper persistence
3.
Form Handling: Adopt react-hook-form + zod for validation
4.
UX Enhancements: Implement infinite scroll, pull-to-refresh, and location features
5.
Job Management: Complete the application management and job action features
The most critical gaps are in the routing system, data persistence, and form validation framework, as these affect the core functionality and user experience of the job posting system.
