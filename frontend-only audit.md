Below is a structured, frontend-only audit comparing what the documentation requires vs. what currently exists in your codebase. I’ve organized it by system document, then included cross-cutting gaps and a prioritized implementation plan.

Key: ✅ Implemented or partial, ⚠️ Partially implemented/mocked, ❌ Missing

- Tech stack requirements (React + TS, MUI, Zustand + TanStack Query, React Router):
  - Zustand + TanStack Query: ✅ used across the app
  - React Router v7: ❌ not used; navigation relies on a bottom tab state in `App.tsx` and sibling variant apps (App.* files)
- Google OAuth (primary), email/password fallback:
  - Google login present in `AuthenticationScreen.tsx` (per earlier matches) but full auth/session management (token storage/refresh) is not visible in code reviewed: ⚠️ partial

  - Form validation framework (e.g., react-hook-form + zod/yup): ❌ not found; current validation appears ad-hoc
  - Save draft/resume onboarding: ⚠️ partially simulated via stores, but no robust resume-flow persistence observed
  - Accessibility (WCAG AA), loading states (skeletons, disabled during submit): ⚠️ some skeletons used elsewhere, not consistently in onboarding
  - Verification processes (ID/equipment/phone/email OTP): ❌ no flows present

  - UI present via a custom bottom navigation: ✅ `components/navigation/BottomNavigation.tsx` , orchestrated by app variants e.g. `App.GetMyGrapher.tsx`

  - Responsive breakpoints used; explicit DesktopProfileView/MobileProfileView components: ❌ not found
- Analytics tracking on profile view interactions:
  - Not clearly implemented: ❌
Cross-Cutting Gaps and Inconsistencies

- Routing vs. docs:
  - Docs standardize on React Router v7; app uses custom bottom navigation and Zustand state to show different views inside “App.*” variants. Consider introducing proper routes for deep-linking, shareable URLs, and native navigation semantics. ❌
- Real-time systems (presence, typing indicators, read receipts):
  - Not implemented across communication and community systems. ❌
- Validation frameworks:
  - No react-hook-form/yup/zod used; validations are manual/inline. ❌
- Location/GPS + Maps:
  - GPS used in onboarding; lack of map integration or reusable location selector components on job creation and homepage. ❌
- Payment/booking/checkout:
  - Booking references exist, but no end-to-end booking request/accept/confirm/payment UX. ❌
- External calendar sync/ICS/timezones:
  - Not implemented. ❌
- Community contribution and moderation:
  - Lacks upload flow, moderation UI, and real-time sync (docs specify Supabase). ❌
- Pro tier gating:
  - Features like “Unlimited Community Posing Library access” vs. free tier not enforced in UI. ❌
- Accessibility:
  - Some ARIA/tab panels used, but overall accessibility targets (WCAG AA) not demonstrably met across flows (e.g., focus management, keyboard nav, semantics, contrast). ⚠️
- Performance:
  - Skeletons exist in some sections; debounce/throttle patterns and query caching strategies vary. No systematic approach surfaced. ⚠️
High-Priority Gaps to Address First

1. 1.
   Replace tab-state navigation with proper routing and URL structure
   - Introduce React Router v7 and route-level code-splitting to match docs.
   - Preserve BottomNavigation, but have it drive navigation via routes instead of only Zustand state.
2. 2.
   Implement schema-based form validation and onboarding completion
   - Adopt react-hook-form + zod/yup for Authentication/onboarding and Job wizard.
   - Add BasicProfileSetupScreen, AvailabilitySetupScreen, RegistrationCompleteScreen and “save draft/resume” persistence.
3. 3.
   Booking workflow MVP
   - Add UI for request → confirm → scheduled states; bind “Book Now” to availability slots; show conflict resolution UI; add notifications.
   - Payment/checkout can be stubbed initially; add clear stubs and routes.
4. 4.
   Communication real-time foundation
   - Add typing indicators and read receipts (mock or wire to a real-time backend later).
   - Finalize contact-sharing UX with consent flow and traceability.
5. 5.
   Community Posing contribution and moderation
   - Add contribution wizard (upload, EXIF extraction preview, manual override, tags).
   - Add moderation dashboards and state transitions; consider wiring to Supabase (if backend ready), otherwise simulate locally with a consistent state model.
6. 6.
   Location and Maps integration
   - Shared LocationInput with GPS and map preview for Job posting and Homepage location switcher.
   - Add distance-based sorting and filter chips.
7. 7.
   Availability advanced features
   - Timezone utilities and a standard date handling layer.
   - ICS export/import placeholders and blackout/holiday UI.
8. 8.
   Accessibility audit and remediation
   - Ensure semantic roles, keyboard nav, focus trapping in dialogs/bottom sheets, color contrast, and screen-reader labels across major flows.
Smaller/Fast-Follow Enhancements

- Homepage search UX: add debounce and fuzzy matching, unify jobs+professionals pipeline, improve “quick filters.”
- Job creation: add rich text (limited formatting), better budget input UX, preview mode parity with doc spec.
- Professional discovery: expand filters (equipment, verification, min rating).
- Profile view privacy gating and mobile/desktop variants.
